# CSS_Ventskovska-Melnyk_RedditAnalysis
This project is a Computational Social Science study. It looks at how people talked about ChatGPT on Reddit in 2023. We compare user comments from the first period of AI excitement and privacy problems (Marchâ€“May) with the later period of company rivalry and critical thinking (December). The goal is to analyze how public feelings and views of the technology changed over time.
